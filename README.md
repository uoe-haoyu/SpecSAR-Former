# SpecSAR-Former

Network Architecture
Core Model & Configuration
Proposed Network: SpecSAR-Former

Configuration File: segformer_lg_unbalanced.py

Architecture Overview
The overall architecture of our proposed SpecSAR-Former network is illustrated in the figure below. The network employs a dual-branch structure to process multispectral and SAR data separately, leveraging our custom-designed DMEM and MMAM modules for cross-modal information interaction and fusion.
